# PyQt5 Image Processing Application

ðŸ“Œ Overview:
This is a PyQt5-based Image Processing Application that allows users to perform various image processing tasks interactively using OpenCV. The application is designed with a GUI interface where users can apply different filters, transformations, and edge detection techniques with real-time control using sliders.

# ðŸŽ¯ Features

Edge Detection: Prewitt, Roberts, Canny, and Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)

Smoothing & Denoising: Gaussian Blur, Median Filtering, and Averaging

Image Transformations: Rotation and Translation

Morphological Operations: Erosion, Dilation, and Opening/Closing

Segmentation: Histogram-based, Otsu's, Adaptive Thresholding, and Manual Thresholding

GUI Elements: Interactive sliders for parameter tuning and real-time image updates

# ðŸš€ðŸ›  Technologies Used

Python (Programming Language)

PyQt5 (GUI Development)

OpenCV (Image Processing)

NumPy (Numerical Computations)



# How to Use

- Click the Load Image button to upload an image.

- Adjust sliders to apply filters, edge detection, and transformations.

- Reset the image anytime using the Reset Button.

- Experiment with different segmentation techniques.

- Implement additional morphological operations
